I am thrilled to share that our paper  
**“Work Hard, Play Harder: Intense Games Enable Recovery from High Mental Workload Tasks”**  
has received an **Honorable Mention Award 🏅** at **CHI 2025** — the premier international conference on Human–Computer Interaction, held this year in Yokohama, Japan 🇯🇵.

## 🧠 Research Motivation
Mental workload (MWL) plays a key role in how people recover after demanding tasks.  
While traditional theories suggest alternating between high and low workload for optimal recovery, **our work investigates whether mentally demanding games can actually *enhance* recovery** after mentally intensive tasks.

---

## 🧪 Study Design
We conducted a **2×2 factorial lab study** with 40 participants.  
- **Work task:** Audio transcription at high vs. low mental demand  
- **Recovery task:** Classic Pac-Man 🎮 with calibrated difficulty levels  
- **Measures:** Self-report (NASA-TLX, REQ, ADACL) + **fNIRS** physiological data from the prefrontal cortex

Participants alternated between high/low work tasks and high/low gameplay demand, while we continuously measured their brain activity and recovery experiences.

---

## 🌟 Key Findings
- **High-demand games can effectively support post-work recovery** — participants showed greater psychological detachment and mastery compared to low-demand games.  
- fNIRS data revealed **distinct hemodynamic patterns** in the DLPFC and OFC during work vs. gameplay, giving new physiological insights into recovery mechanisms.  
- Contrary to conventional expectations, **high MWL work increased energetic arousal**, highlighting the complex relationship between mental effort and recovery needs.

## 🏆 Why It Matters
This study contributes to a better understanding of how mentally demanding leisure activities (like challenging games) can **restore cognitive resources** and help people recover more effectively.  
It also demonstrates the potential of **physiological sensing (fNIRS)** to inform real-time adaptive recovery experiences — a step towards personalized “smart recovery” systems.

Receiving an Honorable Mention at CHI is a huge encouragement for me 🌟
This work represents a bridge between **game research**, **cognitive neuroscience**, and **workplace well-being** — and I’m incredibly grateful to my co-authors and supervisors for their support along the way.
