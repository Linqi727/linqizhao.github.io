## Hi, I'm Linqi Zhao

I'm a PhD researcher at the University of Nottingham, working in the field of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, with a focus on **game-based cognitive recovery**, **neuroimaging (fNIRS)**, and **player experience (PX)**.  
I have a cross-disciplinary background in **industrial design**, **collaborative design research**, and **game experiments**, and my research bridges design practice with computational methods.
